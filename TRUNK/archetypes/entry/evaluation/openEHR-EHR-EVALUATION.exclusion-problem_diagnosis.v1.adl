For example: to record that the subject has not ever had any significant problems or diagnoses; or that the subject has never been diagnosed with diabetes.

This archetype has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any problems or diagnoses within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: recording an exclusion of the previous diagnosis of diabetes during a consultation is only relevant at the time and is effectively obsolete after if the results of a blood glucose test is above diagnostic levels.">
