Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' archetype.

Use as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype in which specific, detailed CLUSTER ear examination archetypes can be nested, including CLUSTERS for examination of the mastoid region, pinna, external auditory canal and tympanic membrane.">

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, OBSERVATION.height.">
