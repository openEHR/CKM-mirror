The scope of this archetype has been constrained to carry the commonest structured components for identifying a specific physical building or landmark. In this context, a complete address may be described using:
- One or more free text 'Address line' data elements to represent the huge variety of ways that ‘street-level' details may need to be recorded; and
- 'Town' to represent a suburb, town, city, village, or community;
- 'District/County' to represent a local government district;
- 'State/Territory/Province’ to represent a major government district;
- ‘Postcode’, and 
- ‘Country'.
However, this archetype can be extended to include additional fine-grained details about the address by nesting the CLUSTER.structured address within the 'Structured address' SLOT.

This CLUSTER.address could also be used as a proxy for an address in formal demographic address data when reviewing a template with domain experts - for example, an assessment where reviewers would expect to see the individual's full contact details at the top of the assessment form. (en)">
