			use = <"Use to record structured and consistent details about a single identified physical site on, or within, the human body. As a fundamental part of clinical practice, humans can describe anatomical locations in a myriad of complex and variable ways.

In practice, some archetypes carry a single data element for carrying a simple description of body site - for example, OBSERVATION.blood_pressure and CLUSTER.symptom when describing ear pain. In this situation, where the value set is predictable and simple to define, this single data element is a very accurate and pragmatic way to record the site in the body and to query at a later date. However in the situation where the anatomical location is not well defined or needs to be determined at run-time, it may be more flexible to use this structured archetype. For example, in the situation where any symptom can be recorded without any predefined scope of the type of symptom, then allowing the use of this archetype to specifically define an anatomical location in the body may be useful. In this case the CLUSTER.symptom archetype also carries a SLOT for 'Structured anatomical location' which can include this archetype to support maximal flexibility in recording anatomical location data.

This archetype is specifically designed to be used within the context of any appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes which supply the context of the anatomical location. 

'Body site name' is the only mandated data point and should be used as the primary data point to record an anatomical location. 

In addition, the 'Body structure' data element permits recording of a less precise context for the identified body site, for example, a limb or a digit. This can be useful to allow clinicians to describe the presence of gout to be located in the 'distal interphalangeal joint' of the 'great toe'. 

Similarly, the data elements 'Laterality', 'Aspect', 'Region', 'Anatomical line' and 'Description' allow for more precise detail to be recorded about the body site. For example, the apex beat oif the heart is typically found at the fifth left intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line, tenderness at McBurney's point on the abdominal wall or a laceration on the palmar aspect of the proximal right thumb.

The archetype contains an 'Alternative structure' SLOT which allows inclusion of additional archetypes that provide an alternative structure for describing the same body site, such as CLUSTER.relative_location or CLUSTER.precise_location, should this be required. In the situation where this archetype can only be used to name a large and/or non-specific body part, the additional use of the CLUSTER.relative_location archetype will support recording of a more precise location - for example, 2 cm anterior to the cubital fossa of the left forearm or 4 cm below R costal margin on the chest wall in the mid-clavicular line.

A combination of the data elements in this archetype can be used to individually record each component of a postcoordinated terminology expression that represents the anatomical site.

If this archetype is used within other archetypes where the specified subject of care is not the individual for whom the record is being created, for example a fetus in-utero, then the anatomical location will be identifying a body site on or within the fetus.">
