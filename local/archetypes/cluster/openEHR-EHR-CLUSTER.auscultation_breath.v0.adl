This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam, CLUSTER.exam-lung or CLUSTER.exam-abdomen archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
