This archetype has been designed to be used in the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT within this archetype to record additional nested levels of structured imaging findings for related body substructures or site-specific findings.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings outside the specified body structure or region. Use other archetypes from the CLUSTER.imaging_exam family for this purpose.

Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
