Navnene på elementene Laboratoriesvar/Svarverdi vil ordinært erstattes i en templat elller applikasjon med navnet på den spesifikke analysen. f.eks. \"Hemoglobin\", og ofte kodet med en terminologi som NLK, SNOMED CT eller LOINC.

Der det kreves mer komplekse svarmønstre kan det være nødvendig å spesialisere denne arketypen, eller erstatte den med en annen.">

			use = <"To record individual, single value laboratory test analyte results, as are common to clinical pathology testing, for example biochemistry, haematology and immunology. Normally used in conjunction with a parent OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result archetype and in some circumstances will be carried within a CLUSTER.laboratory_test_panel archetype, along with other analytes which are normally tested and/or reported as part of a battery,panel or profile, though this is not necessary i.e multiple analytes may be carried directly within the OBERVATION.laboratory_test.

The name attribute of the 'Analyte result' element is normally replaced in a specialisation, template or at run-time to carry the name of the specific analyte e.g. 'Haemoglobin', often coded with a reference terminology such as LOINC, SNOMED CT or NPU.

This archetype may be used within the setting of more complex laboratory/pathology reporting such as Histopathlogy/ Anatomical synoptic reports where quantitative results such as cytometric flow studies or genetic testing are often reported alongside conventional macroscopic and microscopic reporting.">
