This archetype has been developed as a generic pattern for recording any findings in any specified body structure or region however it is intended that specialisations of this archetype will include all anticipated structure- or region-specific findings. For example: CLUSTER.imaging_exam-ovary will support recording of all findings that would be expected in reporting on imaging of the ovary using any radiological modality, including the size of the ovary, largest follicle size and the diameter and description of specific follicles. Similarly, CLUSTER.imaging_exam-lymph_node_group will contain data elements required to record specific findings of a lymph node group, including its location in the body and the number of lymph nodes in the group. 

If an appropriate specialisation is not available for a body structure or region, this generic archetype can be used to record all relevant findings related to the structure or region. 

If an additional significant, but unexpected, finding needs to be recorded within the context of one of the CLUSTER.imaging_finding family of specialisations but there is no relevant data element available to record it, use the generic CLUSTER.imaging_finding archetype nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT to capture the additional information - one instance per finding.

This archetype and its related family of specialisations are designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within other relevant CLUSTER.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If they need to be extended with further levels of detailed findings, additional instances of the CLUSTER.imaging_exam, its specialisations, or CLUSTER.imaging_finding archetypes can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.
