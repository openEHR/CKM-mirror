This archetype has been intended to be used as a generic framework for all symptoms. It has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate including th 'Associated symptom' or 'Previous episode' SLOT within this same CLUSTER.symptom archetype. The specific symptom will be identified by the value for the 'Symptom name' data element, preferably from a selected terminology where available. If clinically required, it can be further extended with symptom-specific content by inclusion of a specific CLUSTER archetype inserted into the 'Specific Details' SLOT - for example, CLUSTER.vertigo or CLUSTER.pain.

Clinicians frequently record 'nil significant' against specific symptoms as an efficient method to indicate that they asked the individual and it was not reported as causing any discomfort or disturbance - effectively used more like a 'normal statement' rather than an explicit exclusion. The 'Nil significant' data element has been deliberately included in this archetype to allows clinicians to record this same information in a simple and effective way in a clinical system. It can be used to drive a user interface, for example if 'Nil significant' is recorded as true then the remaining data elements can be hidden on a data entry screen. This pragmatic approach supports the majority of simple clinical recording requirements around reported symptoms. 

However if there is a clinical imperative to explicitly record that a Symptom was not absolutely not present, for example if it will be used to drive clinical decision support, then it would be preferable to use the CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom archetype. The use of CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom will increase the complexity of template modelling, implementation and querying. It is recommended that the CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom archetype only be considered for use if clear benefit can be identified in specific situations, but should not be used for routine symptom recording.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record that a symptom was absolutely not present - use CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom carefully for specific purposes where the overheads of recording in this way warrant the additional complexity, and only if the 'Nil significant' in this archetype is not specific enough for recording purposes.
