This archetype has been designed to allow gathering of evidence, over time, that support the diagnosis for a given condition or disease. It is intended to be nested within a SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis, or similar summary archetypes, where the name of the condition or diagnosis has already been specified in the EVALUATION, in order to extend its content with this additional and optional dataset. While links within the openEHR Reference Model allow for this linkage to data held elsewhere within the health record, this archetype has been developed to make this functionality explicit, and to enable clinical visibiity and review of this data, where it may be relevant in a template or specification.

The evidence can be entered into the archetype, or the citations can be used to explicitly point to data with the extent of the health record.">
