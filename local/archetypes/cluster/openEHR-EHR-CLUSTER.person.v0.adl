- the name and contact details for a person who holds a physical copy of an advanced care record;
- the name and contact details of a carer in a referral; 
- the name, role and contact details of a member of a care team;
- the role and contact details of a named contact person within an organisation;
- details about a relative in a family history record; or
- a witness to an epileptic fit.

This archetype could also be used as a proxy for formal demographic data when reviewing a template with domain experts - for example, an assessment where reviewers would expect to see the individual's details at the top of the assessment form.

If the CLUSTER.structured_name archetype is nested within the 'Structured name' SLOT, any or all of the structured name elements can be concatenated and represented in the 'Name line' element.">
