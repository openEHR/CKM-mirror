This archetype is designed to be included in Status SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype.

These status qualifiers should be used with care as they are variably applied in practice and interoperability cannot be assured unless usage guidelines are clearly defined within the clinical community in which the 'Problem/Diagnosis' and 'Problem status' archetype pair may be shared.

Full DRG coding will require the DRG data elements from this archetype and the equivalent CLUSTER.procedure_status archetype used within the ACTION.procedure archetype, plus attributes about the patient.

The 'Unspecified' data element has been added to support addition of other qualifiers that might only be used locally or where the use case has not been clearly established at the time of this archetype being published. As other qualifiers are identified they can be added to this archetype as a backwardly compatible revision.">

Este arquétipo foi desenvolvido para ser incluído no slot do Estado no arquétipo EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype.

Estes qualificadores de estado devem ser usados com cuidado, pois eles são variáveis aplicados na prática e a interoperabilidade não pode ser assegurada, salvo se as diretrizes de uso forem claramente definidas dentro da comunidade clínica em que o par de arquétipos 'Problema / Diagnóstico\" e \"Estado do problema' podem ser compartilhados.

A codificação DRG completa vai exigir os elementos de dados DRG deste arquétipo e o arquétipo CLUSTER.procedure_status equivalente, utilizado dentro do arquétipo ACTION.procedure, além de atributos sobre o paciente.

O elemento de dados 'não especificado' foi adicionado para facilitar a adição de outros qualificadores que só podem ser usados localmente ou quando o caso de uso não foi claramente estabelecido no momento em que este arquétipo foi publicado. Como outros qualificadores são identificados, eles podem ser adicionados a este arquétipo como uma revisão retroativa.">
