If more than one anomaly has been identified within the context of the same body structure or region, use a separate instance of this archetype to describe each anomaly.

The intended scope for this archetype is to record detailed findings about an anomaly using any modality.

If a specific archetype to record the anomaly is not available, use this generic archetype to record relevant findings.

Until the specific archetypes are developed, current use cases include, but are not limited to:
- a large, mixed solid/cystic lesion containing teeth and hair, identified within the ovary - for example, a dermoid cyst;
- a solid mass identified within the right upper lobe of the lung - for example, a past infection scar or a tumour;
- a calcified lesion identified within the left kidney - for example, a kidney calculus; or
- a soft tissue mass identified within the heart - for example, a thrombosis.
