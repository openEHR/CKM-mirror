This archetype is designed specifically to be used in the \"Test findings\" SLOT within the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test archetype, but may also be used withing other ENTRY class archetypes where appropriate.

Detailed structured findings are captured within child cluster archetypes.">

Not to be used to record an autopsy report, although tests on some specimens that are taken at autopsy may be represented using this archetype.">
