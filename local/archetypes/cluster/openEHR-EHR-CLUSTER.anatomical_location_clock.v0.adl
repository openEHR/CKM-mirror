Noen arketyper inneholder et enkelt dataelement for å registrere en enkel beskrivelse av et kroppssted, f.eks OBSERVATION.blood_pressure eller CLUSTER.symptom_sign for å beskrive øresmerter. I slike situasjoner, der verdisettet er forutsigbart og lett å definere, er et slikt enkelt dataelement en svært nøyaktig og pragmatisk måte å registrere kroppssteder slik at de kan gjenfinnes ved senere spørringer. I situasjoner der den anatomiske lokaliseringen ikke er veldefinert eller utledes på stedet, kan det imidlertid være mer fleksibelt å bruke denne strukturerte arketypen.

Arketypen er spesifikt utviklet for å brukes innenfor en hvilken som helst passende ENTRY- eller CLUSTER-arketype som gir kroppsstedet en kontekst. Den kan også brukes innenfor CLUSTER.anatomical_location, i SLOTet \"Alternativ struktur\".

I situasjoner der CLUSTER.anatomical_location kun kan brukes for å angi et større og/eller uspesifikt kroppsområde, kan bruk av denne arketypen innenfor \"Alternativ struktur\"-SLOTet støtte en mer presis registrering. For eksempel en hemorroide kl 7, der referansepunktet kl 12 er perineum og med pasienten i litotomiposisjon.">

In practice, some archetypes carry a single data element for carrying a simple description of body site - for example, OBSERVATION.blood_pressure and CLUSTER.symptom when describing ear pain. In this situation, where the value set is predictable and simple to define, this single data element is a very accurate and pragmatic way to record the site in the body and to query at a later date. However in the situation where the anatomical location is not well defined or needs to be determined at run-time, it may be more flexible to use this structured archetype.

This archetype is specifically designed to be used within the context of any appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes which supply the context of the identified body site, or nesting within the CLUSTER.anatomical_location archetype's 'Alternative Structure SLOT.'

In the situation where the CLUSTER.anatomical_location can only be used to name a large and/or non-specific body part, the use of this archetype within the 'Alternative Structure' SLOT will support recording of a more precise location - for example, a haemorrhoid located at 7 o'clock, where the 12 o'clock referenct point is the perineum with the patient in the lithotomy position.">
