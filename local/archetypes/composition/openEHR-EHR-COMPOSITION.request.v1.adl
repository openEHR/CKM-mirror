			use = <"Use as basis for a request for advice, a service or transfer of care from a healthcare provider or organisation about the subject of care. This document will typically include details about the scope and duration of validity of the request, as well as relevant clinical information about the subject. Requests can vary from a simple request for a consultation, seeking recommendation about further action, requesting a specific procedure or diagnostic test, through to full handover of care and clinical responsibility to the receiving healthcare provider.

Use cases include, but are not limited to a request for:
- a consultation, second opinion or management advice from a specialist;
- a diagnostic test;
- home care from visiting nurses;
- transfer of care to a rehabilitation facility;
- for aged care assessment;
- for a medication review by a pharmacist; and
- for provision of physiotherapy or occupational therapy.

Requests may be targeted (identifying a specific healthcare provider or organisation to carry out the request) or untargeted (identifying only the type of care desired).">
