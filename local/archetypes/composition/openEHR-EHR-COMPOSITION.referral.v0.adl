			purpose = <"To transmit a request from one treating healthcare provider or organisation to another, for a variety of purposes ranging from seeking recommendation about further action, requesting a specific procedure or diagnostic test, through to complete transfer of care, for an identified patient.">
			use = <"Use to transmit a request from one treating healthcare provider or organisation to another for an identified patient, usually including clinically significant background information about the patient as well as the exact details of the request itself. The request can range in scope and duration of validity. Requests can vary from a simple request for consultation and recommendations for further treatment or management, through to full handover of care and clinical responsibility to the receiving healthcare provider. The duration of the referral can also vary from a specified time period, through to an indefinite and ongoing referral.

Examples of use cases:
- Request for a consultation and management advice from a specialist;
- Request for care from home nursing care;
- Request for aged care assessment;
- Request for a medication review by a phamacist; and
- Request for provision of physiotherapy or occupational therapy.

Referrals may be targeted (identifying a specific healthcare provider or organisation to carry out the request) or untargeted (identifying only the type of care desired).">
