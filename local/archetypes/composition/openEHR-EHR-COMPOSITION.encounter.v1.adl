			use = <"Use as a generic document-level container for recording details of a single interaction, contact or care event between a subject of care and healthcare provider(s). 
The contact may be face-to-face, via telephone or another electronic medium. Modality can be captured, if required, via the reference model COMPOSITION/mode attribute.

The main Sections/Content component has been deliberately left unconstrained. This will allow it to be populated with any SECTION or ENTRY archetypes appropriate for the clinical purpose within a template. 

Even though unconstrained for clinical content, specification of COMPOSITION.Encounter provides significant value by allowing for explicit querying of all Encounters within a patient record.

The Context component contains an optional 'Extension' SLOT that can be used in template design to:
- add optional contextual information, such as episode information; or
- allow for harmonisation or alignment with other model formalisms such as FHIR or CIMI, such as explicit representation of participants that are usually managed by the openEHR Reference Model in an openEHR archetype.

Typical examples are a clinic visit, a nursing observation or a telemedicine consultation.">
