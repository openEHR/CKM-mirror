			purpose = <"To record details of pharmacogenetic phenotype findings relating to a single genotype, in particular to record metaboliser status / functional activity against an enzyme known to impact the effectiveness/ toxicity of one or more medications.

As individual pharmacogenetic tests may provide only incomplete allele testing, this archetype is intended to act as an overall cumulative representation of tall individual tests, from which therapeutic recommendations should be derived.">
			use = <"There is crossover in purpose with the Precaution archetype https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.2593, but this is designed to record many different therapeutic precautions, and to report only adverse effects e.g poor efficacy or toxicity, whereas this archetype is intended to capture both positive and negative effects and normal metaboliser status. 

In that respect this is perhaps closer to a a diagnosis then a risk factor or precaution.

There is an argument that Precaution might be used to flag the presence of significant phenotypes, perhaps as a general statement such as 'Significant known metaboliser issues'  which reference the specific Phenotypic records.

The main content is intended to be carried in a slotted CLUSTER Pharmacogenetics analyte result archetype=, but in this context to record the cumulative results and not that of a single test.">
