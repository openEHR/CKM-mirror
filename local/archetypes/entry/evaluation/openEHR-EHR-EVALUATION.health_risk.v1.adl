For example: an infant given gentamicin in neonatal intensive care is regarded as having a risk of permanent hearing loss. If diagnostic testing shows no evidence of hearing loss in the first year of life, the risk of later hearing loss is considered to be much reduced, but still possible. This data element allows clinicians to say that the risk has been mitigated but should still be considered as a possibility in future. In practice, the risk factor could be maintained in the risk assessment in case it might impact the individual's health at a future time, but flagging that its contribution to risk calculation may not be as great as if it had not been previously treated or investigated.
