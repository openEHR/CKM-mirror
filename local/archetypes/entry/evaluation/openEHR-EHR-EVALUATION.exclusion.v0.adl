This archetype has been specifically designed to make a clear and unambiguous statement of exclusion of a type of clinical item from the health record. This approach is used in preference to relying on flags or terminology to express negation.

This archetype has been designed to be used in a variety of ways. The primary intent is to:
- represent multiple 'Exclusion statements' in one archetype instance; and
- link one 'Exclusion statement' with multiple 'Specific items', for example 'No past adverse reaction to' 'penicillin' and 'erythromicin'.

There is also the possibility to use the archetype for the following purposes, although clear and safe clinical use cases have not yet been identified:
- to link multiple 'Exclusion statements' with one 'Specific item'. 

If the clinical requirement is to link multiple 'Exclusion statements' with multiple 'Specific items' then this should be represented using multiple instances of this archetype to ensure correct alignment of each 'Exclusion statement' with each 'Specific item'.

Specialisations of this archetype have been developed to capture specific and more detailed information about common exclusions, such as problems or diagnoses. 

Please note that exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the point-in-time of recording. It is possible for a record to be able to state that an individual has NO KNOWN history of XYZ (using an exclusion statement) at the same time as recording the evidence of their first experience of XYZ (using the corresponding archetype that records the first experience eg via an EVALUATION for a diagnosis or adverse reaction). In future record statements, the individual may subsequently have a KNOWN history of XYZ recorded in their problem list.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion or absence of clinical information for which there is a purpose-built specialisation. This includes, but is not limited to the following:
- Do not use this archetype to record the exclusion  of medication use - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-medication archetype for this purpose.
- Do not use this archetype to record the exclusion of procedures - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-procedure archetype for this purpose.
- Do not use this archetype to record the exclusion of problems or diagnoses - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-problem_diagnosis archetype for this purpose.
- Do not use this archetype to record the exclusion of family history - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-family_history archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of any component of physical examination - use the CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetype.">

In these examples, 'corticosteroids', 'penicillin', 'heart disease', 'diabetes' would be examples of the 'Specific item' and the rest of the example phrase would be carried in the 'Exclusion statement'. Other possible use cases might be: exclusion of pregnancy, never X-rayed, or received a blood transfusion.
