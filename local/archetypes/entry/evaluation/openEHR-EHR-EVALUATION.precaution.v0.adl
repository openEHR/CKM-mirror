This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for any relevant therapeutic precautions as a clinician commences a new clinical intervention for an individual. 

Examples of conditions that warrant creation of a precaution include, but are not limited to:
- Immunosuppressed/on immunosuppressive therapy – linked to medication order for chemo or steroids; or diagnosis of leukaemia;
- Renal failure – linked to renal function tests and/or a formal diagnosis of renal failure;
- Waiting for organ transplant;
- Transplanted organ in situ;
- Metal implant in situ:
- Ongoing investigation or follow up of suspected or verified malignant disease;
- Participation in a pharmacological trial; or
- Using anticoagulant treatment.">

'Resolved' may be used variably across systems, depending on clinical use and context. The free text data type will allow for local variation by enabling other value sets to be applied to this data element in a template - in this situation it is recommended that values should be coded using a terminology.">
