			purpose = <"*To record information about any harmful, desirable or unexpected reaction to a substance or agent, including:
- immune mediated reactions Types I-IV (including true allergic reactions and hypersensitivities), and 
- non-immune mediated reactions (including pseudoallergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, drug toxicities (eg Gentamicin), drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and idiosyncratic reactions).

To record information about previous exposures to a substance, allowing a persisting and evolving summary of adverse reaction events to build up over time.

To record additional information that will support and inform a clinical assessment of the propensity of an individual to experience an adverse reaction if exposed to a specific substance, class of substance or agent in the future.(en)">
			use = <"*Use to record all information about the presence of adverse reaction/s (including an allergic reaction/s)  to a substance to support direct clinical care of an individual; as part of a managed Adverse Reaction list; to enable safe exchange of information about adverse reactions; and to assist computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

Use to provide a single place within the health record to record a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions, including:  
-  record cumulative information about each exposure to a known substance, class of substance or agent; and 
-  record a clinician's opinion that administration of, or exposure to, a substance or agent is absolutely contraindicated.

This archetype has been designed to allow recording of information about a more generic substance, class of substance or agent, and then allow more specific details to be recorded including identification of the specific substance on a per exposure basis, including links to other parts of the health record where further details may be located. Note:  it is possible on second or subsequent exposures to a previously identified substance for a reaction not to occur and this archetype allows for these events to be closely linked in a way that will assist in determining if the adverse reaction has been incorrectly identified.

Design of this archetype has been deliberatly focused on identifying a pragmatic, core data set that will be suitable for most common use clinical scenarios but permits extension of the model when additional detail is required through incorporation of additional archetypes in the 'Additional Reaction Detail', 'Additional Exposure Detail', and 'Reporting Details' slots. Examples of clinical situations where the extension will be required are for a detailed immunology assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or clinical trial use.

A data element for Substance Category has not been modelled as this should be able to be derived from any coded entry for Substance/Agent and be used in decision support activities. A coded Category is not adequate to support decision support if Substance/Agent is only entered via free text.

The act of recording an adverse reaction in the health record implies there is a potential hazard for the individual if they are exposed to the same substance/agent in the future - a relative contraindication. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/agent again, for example, following a manifestation of anaphylaxis, the 'Absolute contraindication' data flag should be recorded as ‘True’. Note: Conversely, a statement about ‘Severity’ of propensity (with possible values such as Mild, Moderate and Severe) has deliberately not been modelled explicitly. Predicting or estimating the grade of possible severity of a future reaction is not safe to record and persist in data, except where it is absolutely clear that the risk of deliberate re-exposure is unacceptable and highly likely to cause significant harm, such as a previous manifestation of anaphylaxis, and in this case the ‘Absolute contraindication’ data flag should be used. 

Valuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:
- statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure,
- source of the information/reporter, and
- a flag for absolute contra-indication. 
Second-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.

A formal Adverse Reaction Report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details of the adverse reaction. The report will be comprised of this Adverse Reaction archetype plus a variable number of others - for example, demographics, weight, medication and problem/diagnosis.(en)">
