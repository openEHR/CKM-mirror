			purpose = <"*To record the clinical assessment of the propensity for an individual to experience an adverse reaction if exposed, or re-exposed, to a specified substance or class of substances. (en)">
			use = <"*Use to record a clinical assessment of a propensity for an adverse reaction upon future exposure to a specified substance or class of substances, including, but not limited to, incipients and excipients in medicinal preparations, biological products, metal salts, and organic chemical compounds.  

This archetype is intended to provide a single place within the health record to document the propensity for the full range of reactions, from trivial to life-threatening:
- immune-mediated: Types I-IV (including allergic reactions and hypersensitivities); or 
- non-immune-mediated: including pseudo-allergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, and drug toxicities.
In clinical practice distinguishing between immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated reactions can be difficult. Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient.

Identification of the severity of the manifestation of the reaction can inform the 'Criticality' of the adverse reaction risk - for example, experiencing anaphylaxis on first exposure to a substance would warrant setting a 'Criticality' of 'high', due to the high risk that anaphylaxis is likely to recur on second and subsequent exposures.

Where a propensity is identified, information or evidence about one or more reaction events can be recorded using the CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event archetype in the 'Reaction event summary' SLOT.

This archetype has been designed to allow the recording of information about a specific substance (amoxycillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or, alternatively, a class of substance (e.g. Penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded, identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per-reaction basis using the CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event archetype.

Use to record information about the positive presence of the risk of an adverse reaction:
- to support the direct clinical care of an individual; 
- as part of a managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list; 
- to support the exchange of information about the propensity and events related to adverse reactions; 
- to inform adverse reaction reporting; and 
- to assist with computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

The risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation must always propose a causative substance or class of substance. If there is a degree of uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, the level of uncertainty can be recorded using the ‘Verification status’ data element. If more than one possible substance may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this adverse reaction risk archetype with the ‘Verification status’ set to an initial state of ‘Unconfirmed’ so that adverse reaction checking can be activated in clinical systems. If the substance is later proven not to be causal then the ‘Verification status’ can be modified to ‘Refuted’ - for example, after allergy testing.

The scope of this archetype has deliberately focused on identifying a pragmatic data set that are used in most clinical systems or will be suitable for most common clinical scenarios; however, it permits extension of the model when additional detail is required, using the 'Reaction details', 'Exposure details', and 'Reporting details' slots. An extension may be required if a specialist allergist or immunologist needed to record a more detailed assessment as part of a report to regulatory bodies or within the context of a clinical trial.
