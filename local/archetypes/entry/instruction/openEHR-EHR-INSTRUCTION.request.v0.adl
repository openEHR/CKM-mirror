			purpose = <"Generic framework for a request for a health-related service to be supplied by a healthcare provider or agency.">
			use = <"Use to record a request for a health-related service. This archetype has been designed as a framework that can be used as the basis for:
- a request from one healthcare provider or agency to another healthcare provider or agency for a health-related service - for example, a request for transfer of care to an emergency department, a referral for a second clinical opinion, or provision of home services from a municipal council; or
- a follow up service to be scheduled for the same healthcare provider or agency - for example, a review appointment in outpatients in 6 weeks. 

In many situations it will be possible to record the steps that occur as part of this request being carried out using the corresponding generic ACTION.request. However, there will be many occasions where the required ACTION archetype will be very specific for purpose, as the data requirements for recording provision of many health-related services will need quite unique data elements, recording patterns or pathway steps. For example: ACTION.screening or ACTION.health_education.">

- Laboratory test request - use the INSTRUCTION.request-laboratory_test archetype;
