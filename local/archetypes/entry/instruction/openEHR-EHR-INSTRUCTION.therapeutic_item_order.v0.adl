It is intended to be used for any type of medical order, whether prescribed by a health professional or available for purchase 'over the counter'. The scope of this therapeutic item archetype includes orders for assistive devices such as wheelchairs, casts or crutches, other medical devices, bandages, or other items that are applied or administered to have a therapeutic effect and which have a common pattern for data recording.

This archetype is designed to be used in a number of clinical contexts, including but not limited to:
- a record in a clinical consultation (COMPOSITION.encounter);
- a written prescription by a physician, dentist, nurse practitioner, or other designated health professional for a therapeutic item to be dispensed, administered and/or applied (within a COMPOSITION.prescription);
- an item in a summary document such as transfer of care (COMPOSITION.transfer_summary) or a referral (COMPOSITION.request).

This archetype has been designed to allow for recording various types of medical orders, including but not limited to:
- Order a cast for 6 weeks to treat an ankle fracture
- Order a Frejka pillow for treatment for developmental dysplasia of the hip
- Order PEP device
