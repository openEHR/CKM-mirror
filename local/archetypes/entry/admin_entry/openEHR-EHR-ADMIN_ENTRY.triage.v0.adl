This archetype has been designed to provide a generic framework for any triage priority, which may be specifically defined for a specific clinical location or event within a template for a specified clinical scenario. The triage priority may be time-related, indicating that the patient must be attended to within a specified timeframe.

This archetype may be specialised to represent specific triage assessment tools.">
