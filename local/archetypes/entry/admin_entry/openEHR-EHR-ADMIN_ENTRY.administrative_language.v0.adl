In clinical systems it is common to record whether a interpreter is required as a simple, stand-alone boolean data point - the language for translation required is implied, rather than specified. However if this single boolean is exchanged to a location where the assumed language is different, the recorded boolean may be incorrect. In order for this data to be correctly exchanged, both the language and requirement for translation needs to be exchanged as a pair.

For each language that is proposed for a clinical communication it will be necessary to do a separate assessment about whether a translator is required for the individual. For example, an English speaker in Quebec will not require an English interpreter but may require one if the consultation is being conducted in French. ">
