Busca identificar el riesgo de estados de desnutrición proteico-calórica mas que el estado de nutrientes individuales. No ha sido diseñada para detectar deficiencias o excesos en la ingesta de vitaminas y minerales.

Paso 1.- Medición de la altura y el peso para determinar el puntaje para el Índice de Masa Corporal (BMI, del inglés Body Mass Index). Si no es posible obtener la altura y el peso, se deben utilizar los procedimientos alternativos descritos en el Manual explicativo MUST.
Paso 2.- Determina el porcentaje de perdida de peso no esperada y el puntaje que corresponde a dicho porcentaje.
Paso 3.- Establecer el puntaje correspondiente al efecto de una enfermedad aguda.
Paso 4.- Sumas los puntajes de los pasos 1, 2 y 3 para obtener el riesgo total de malnutrición.
Paso 5.- Utilizar las guías de manejo y/o las políticas locales para desarrollar un plan de cuidados.
Este arquetipo permite registrar los datos para el cálculo del riesgo total de malnutrición.">

It intends to identify risk of poor protein-energy status, rather than status of individual nutrients.

			use = <"MUST is a five-step screening tool:
Step 1.- Measure height and weight to get a BMI score. If unable to obtain height and weight, the alternative procedures shown in the MUST Explanatory Booklet should be used.
Step 2.- Note percentage unplanned weight loss and score using tool specific tables.
Step 3.- Establish acute disease effect and score.
Step 4.- Add scores from steps 1, 2 and 3 together to obtain overall risk of malnutrition.
Step 5.- Use management guidelines and/or local policy to develop care plan.
This archetype registers data for calculation of the overall risk of malnutrition score.">
