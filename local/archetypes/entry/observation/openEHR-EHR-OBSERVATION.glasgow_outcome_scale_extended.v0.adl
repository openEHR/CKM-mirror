Et gyldig resultat av en GOSE vurdering er at \"Kategori\" elementet ikke vil ha et resultat. Ordinalen \"99\" i noen elementer skal representere et svaralternativ uten en verdi, og enhver form for kalkulasjon av Kategori bør ta hensyn til dette. \"Kategori\"-elementet bør stå tomt dersom laveste registrerte verdi er \"99\".

A valid outcome of a GOSE assessment is that the 'Category' will have no result. The ordinal '99' in some elements is intended to represent an unscored value, and any Category calculation should take this into account. The 'Category' data element should remain empty if the lowest recorded ordinal value is '99'.">
