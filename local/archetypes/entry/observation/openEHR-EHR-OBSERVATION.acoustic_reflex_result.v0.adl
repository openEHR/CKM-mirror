			use = <"Use to record measurements from a single acoustic reflext test, for diagnostic or screening purposes. Ipsilateral testing, contralateral testing or both, can be recorded per test ear.

Use to record the interpretation of all measurements for each single ear test configuration, and an overall interpretation (or audiological diagnosis).

Acoustic reflexes measure the eardrum movement generated by the stapedius and tensor tympani reflex in response to intense sound. The acoustic reflex threshold can be helpful in checking for particular types of hearing loss in situations where patient reliability is questionable. Acoustic reflex testing can also be done as part of a battery of tests to investigate central nervous system pathology, although this usage is now uncommon.">
