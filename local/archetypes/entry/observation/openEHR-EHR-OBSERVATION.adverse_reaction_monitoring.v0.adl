This archetype has been designed to capture that an agent was administered to an individual and whether a reaction occurred in response. It includes details about the context of administration, such as corticosteroid cover or location in ICU. It is not intended to carry any details about a reaction that occurred - use the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype for this purpose.">
