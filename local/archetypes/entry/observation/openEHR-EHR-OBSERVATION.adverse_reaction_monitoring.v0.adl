This archetype has been designed to capture whether a reaction occurred after administration of an agent to an individual. It includes details about any mitigation efforts in the context of administration, such as corticosteroid cover, or ICU admission. Summary details about a reaction that occurred can be recorded using the CLUSTER.reaction_event_summary in the 'Reaction event summary' SLOT.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record a propensity of the individual to have adverse reactions to specific substances or groups or classes of substances. Use the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype for this purpose.">
