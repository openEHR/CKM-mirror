As there is no standard model for the component variables that make up PEWS, this archetype has been designed to provide a framework in which one specific PEWS representation can be selected and added to the 'PEWS components' SLOT added as CLUSTERs in a template.">

- OBSERVATION.blood_pressure;
- OBSERVATION.pulse;
- OBSERVATION.respiration;
- OBSERVATION.body_temperature;
- OBSERVATION.acvpu; and
- OBSERVATION.pulse_oximetry.

Not to be used for adults. Use an archetype representing the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) for this purpose.

Not to be used during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Use a pregnancy-specific archetype such as Maternal Early Warning Score or Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score for this purpose.">
