An alcohol consumption diary could be built up over time by recording the consumption of alcohol on multiple, sequential days - recording actual consumptions using the 'Specified Day' event for each daily entry.

A record of average alcohol use during a period can be recorded by recording the amount of alcohol consumed using the 'Average use' event - the mean use over a specified period of time.

Data that might be used to assess the risk of alcohol abuse or dependence will be recorded using two archetypes: this OBSERVATION archetype (recording the repeatable observations/measurements)  and in the EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary archetype (recording the summary and persisting data).

Binge drinking is not directly referred to in this archetype, yet this archetype will be a key resource used to support the identification of binge drinking through the accurate recording of the amount and frequency of drinking, triggers and social/cultureal context of consumption. The assessment of 'binge drinking' may be recorded as part of a 'Problem List'.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording persistent, summary details about typical patterns of alcohol drinking. Use the EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record an assessment about alcohol dependence. Use specific archetypes for this purpose, for example the AUDIT assessment - openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.alcohol_audit.

Not to be used to record information about consumption of other substances other than alcohol.">
