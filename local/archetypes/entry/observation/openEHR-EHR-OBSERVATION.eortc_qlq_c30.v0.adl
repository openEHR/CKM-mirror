O questionário básico, o QLQ-C30, é o resultado de mais de uma década de pesquisa colaborativa. Após seu lançamento geral em 1993, o QLQ-C30 foi usado numa ampla gama de ensaios clínicos de cancro, por um grande número de grupos de pesquisa; Além disso, foi utilizado em vários outros estudos não experimentais. Estão presentes 30 itens de funcionamento físico, pessoal, emocional e social, bem como cognição, sintomas (por exemplo, fadiga, dor e dispneia) e qualidade de vida global de pacientes com cancro.">

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.  A high scale score represents a higher response level.Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.">

					comment = <"Le QLQ-C30 est composé à la fois d'échelles à plusieurs éléments et de mesures à un seul élément. Celles-ci comprennent cinq échelles fonctionnelles, trois échelles de symptômes, une échelle d'état de santé global / QoL et six éléments individuels. Chacune des échelles à plusieurs items comprend un ensemble différent d'items - aucun item ne se retrouve dans plus d'une échelle. Toutes les échelles et les mesures à un seul élément ont un score allant de 0 à 100. Un score élevé sur une échelle représente un niveau de réponse plus élevé. Ainsi, un score élevé pour une échelle fonctionnelle représente un niveau de fonctionnement élevé / sain, un score élevé pour l'état de santé global / la qualité de vie représente une qualité de vie élevée, mais un score élevé pour une échelle / item de symptôme représente un niveau élevé de symptomatologie / problèmes.
