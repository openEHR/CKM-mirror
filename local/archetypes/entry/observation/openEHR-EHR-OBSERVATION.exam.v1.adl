Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.

Use as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype in which specific, detailed CLUSTER examination archetypes can be nested. Examples of CLUSTER examination archetypes include those that detail the inspection, palpation, auscultation, percussion and movement of body systems or anatomical structures.">

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, or OBSERVATION.height.">
