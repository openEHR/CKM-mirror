			use = <"Use to record the results of the AUDIT screening test (or the AUDIT-C subset) as a means to identify individuals with hazardous and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption, indicators of alcohol dependence and some consequences from harmful drinking. The test can be administered during an oral interview or as a self-reported questionnaire.

Each of the questions in the AUDIT test will be recorded as a separate data element. For pragmatic reasons, in this archetype, each data element is not labelled as the full question, but as a summary of the question topic. The full question to which each data element refers is identified in the 'Description' for each data element. For example: \"How often did you have six or more drinks on one occasion in the past year?\" is represented as the 'Bingeing' data element.

The AUDIT-C test is a shortened version of the full AUDIT test, using only the first three questions related to consumption.">

Not to be used to record an overview of the individual's pattern of alcohol consumption - use the EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary for this purpose.">
