The value of PaO2 will be usually be recorded elsewhere in the health record as part of an arterial blood gas test result (OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result).
The value of FiO2 will usually be recorded elsewhere in the health record using at0052 within the CLUSTER.inspired_oxygen, typically as part of an arterial blood gas test result or pulse oximetry (OBSERVATION.pulse_oximetry).

This ratio may be used within other scores, such as SMART-COP risk score.">
