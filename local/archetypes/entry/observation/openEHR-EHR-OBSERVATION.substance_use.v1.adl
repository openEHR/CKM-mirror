A typical use of this archetype will be related to a diary record of use or consumption of substances, especially those with addictive properties.  ">

Do not use this archetype for recording use or consumption histories for common substances such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.  As these are so commonly consumed, data should be recorded using detailed and specific specialisations of this archetype.">
