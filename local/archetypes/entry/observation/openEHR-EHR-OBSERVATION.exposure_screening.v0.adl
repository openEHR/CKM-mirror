Examples of agents and groupings of agents are 'hepatitis C' and 'blood borne infectious agents'; or 'asbestos' and 'carcinogenic substances'.

Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation related to exposure, for example:
--- Have you been to a malaria endemic area in the last 6 weeks?
--- Have you had a bee sting in the last 8 weeks?
--- Have you worked in a slaughterhouse in the last 3 months? 
--- Have you ever lived or worked in a building with asbestos?
--- Have you ever shared used injection needles?
--- Have you eaten chicken from ACME Chicken Company in the last 24 hours?
--- Did your parents smoke inside the house when you were a child?

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about exposure that has happened at any time in the past and information about exposure within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Have you ever used any drug by injection?\" compared to \"Have you injected any drug during the last 6 months?\".

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of exposure it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the exposure using a relevant exposure archetype, for example the EVALUATION.exposure to record details about the actual exposure.
