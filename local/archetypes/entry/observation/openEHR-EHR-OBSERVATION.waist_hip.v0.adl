Use to enter the Waist-hip ratio either manually (ie calculated and directly entered by the clinician), or automatically (ie calculation and entry is done automatically by a software application, based on separate waist and hip circumference measurements).

Formulas: Waist-hip ration is usually calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H).">
