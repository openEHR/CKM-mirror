			use = <"Use to record child’s Minimum Response Levels (MRL’s) and reflexive responses (eg. APR) to noisemakers and speech. Recorded in the free-field measuring a binaural response. 

Use to record an overall interpretation of response levels and response qualities to provide an indication of the probable hearing status. 
BOA is generally used as a secondary testing technique in infants under 6mo to provide supporting information to objective measures of hearing levels (ABR/SSEP). In cases where an infant cannot be conditioned to VROA, is not developmentally able to perform VROA, or if VROA equipment is unavailable, BOA may be used to obtain information about behavioural hearing. 

Please note: 
- MRL: the lowest intensity level at which a response to a stimulus is recorded. An ascending technique should be used when establishing MRL’s.
- dBA: Decibels measured in the sound field using the A scale sound level filter. Using this filter, the sound level meter is thus less sensitive to very high and very low frequencies

Details about assisted hearing devices used as aids in this test should be recorded in the EVALUATION.assisted_hearing_summary.">
