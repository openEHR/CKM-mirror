			use = <"Use to record the results of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and it's subset assessments. The current archetype only has data elements required for the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9.

The archetype has been designed such that the actual PHQ questions are recorded as the Description for each questionnaire data element. The data element name is a pragmatic description that is indicative of the question intent.

The original PHQ‐9 tool was developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams, Kurt Kroenke and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc. From the PHQ Screeners website (http://www.phqscreeners.com/overview.aspx): \"All PHQ, GAD-7 screeners and translations are downloadable from this website and no permission is required to reproduce, translate, display or distribute them.\" And from the PHQ webpage (http://www.phqscreeners.com/pdfs/01_PHQ/English.pdf): \"No permission required to reproduce, translate, display or distribute\". 

The Australian indigenous adaptation for the PHQ-9 subset assessing mood was developed by Dr. Alex Brown, Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs, 2009. The adapted questions are expressed within the Comments area for each questionnaire data element. Used with permission.">
