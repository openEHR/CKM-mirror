			use = <"'howRU' (TM) is a generic patient-reported outcomes instrument, designed to meet these requirements, and answer the central question: \"How are you today?\"
 It has four dimensions, which reflect the presence or absence of what matters most to patients, in addition to survival:
- Symptoms such as pain ­ includes discomfort such as breathlessness or nausea
- Feeling low or worried ­ includes anxiety, depression and fatigue.
- Limits to what you can do ­ includes physical incapacity, loss of memory, sight or hearing.
- Dependence on others ­ reliance on other people or equipment.

For each dimension, the patient picks one of four levels, indicated using a traffic-light metaphor with labels, colour, position and images. 
The four dimensions and four levels give 256 (44) different permutations, each of which represents a different health state. For data storage and analysis, each level is recorded on a 0-3 ordinal scale, with none = 3, slight = 2 quite a lot = 1, and extreme = 0. Higher score means better health. A simple aggregate howRU score is calculated by adding the scores for each dimension, giving a range from 12 (4 x none, ceiling) to 0 (4 x extreme, floor).
