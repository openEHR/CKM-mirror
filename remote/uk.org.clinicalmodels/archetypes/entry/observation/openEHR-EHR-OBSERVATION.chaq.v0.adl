The questionnaire is completed by parents or carers of the child, and it is intended that the person completing the questionnaire checks the one response which best describes the child's usual activities (averaged over an entire day) OVER THE PAST WEEK. It is also intended that only those difficulties or limitations are noted which are due to illness. If most children at the child's age are not expected to do a certain activity, the responder should mark it as \"Not Applicable\". For example, if the child has difficulty in doing a certain activity or is unable to do it because he/she is too young but not because he/she is RESTRICTED BY ILLNESS, the activity should be marked as \"NOT Applicable\".">
