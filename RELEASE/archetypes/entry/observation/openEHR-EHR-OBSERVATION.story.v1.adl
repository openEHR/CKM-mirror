			use = <"Use to record the formal 'History of Presenting Complaint' by a clinician, as told to them by a patient; or use to record an individual's own account of their 'story' of symptoms, for example in a personal health record.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Story' data element.

Use to record a simple narrative and/or as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype framework which can be extended by the inclusion of additional, specific and detailed CLUSTER archetypes, each of which will describe the various aspects of the clinical history. Examples of history-related CLUSTER archetypes include CLUSTER.symptom or CLUSTER.health_event.">
